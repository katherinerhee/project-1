            During my Study Abroad trip to Paris in Summer 2010, we were able/encouraged
            to fly to other cities in Europe on the weekends since the price of 
            transportation to other European cities is usually very reasonable.

            One of the five roommates that I had in Paris, Daria, and I flew out of 
            Charles de Guille (CDG) airport Thursday evening after class to Dublin. I had
            not yet seen this part of the airport - the terminal was beautifully built with
            glass and wood into a tunnel-like structure.
          </li>
          <li class="trip-detail">
            The plane that took us to Dublin was so tiny! It had to have been the smallest
            plane that I had ever been on and we boarded it by walking onto the runway area
            rather than through a gate. The sunset and view flying to Dublin was incredibly
            beautiful. The Dublin Airport looks deceivingly small - it is actually huge! 
            We received awesome, huge, green stamps from customs officials (they just
            scream <cite>"I've been to Ireland!"</cite>).

            We had trouble finding the Airlink Bus that would take us into the city, but we
            asked a very nice gentleman working at the airport. He looked busy but immediately
            dropped everything and escorted us to the bus stop. Once we arrived at the Central
            Bus Station in Dublin, we were trying to figure out which way to go to our hostel
            when another nice man came to our rescue. He not only pointed us in the right
            direction but also walked part of the way with us. It seemed like in Dublin, you
            don't even need to ask for help (or a map). You could just appear to be lost and
            people jump at the chance to help you. I wish we had more of this kind of 
            hospitality in the United States! Daria and I were even taken aback and wary at
            times since we were not used to such friendliness (a sad testament to Americans).

          <li class="trip-detail">
            Our hostel, the Ashfield House, turned out to be right next to a nightclub. It
            even provided ambient music through the walls while you tried to fall asleep.
            We were placed in the Ashfield Room (18 bunk beds with a fairly gross 
            bathroom) but nice compared to other hostels. The receptionist at the front desk
            explained that since we were in the largest room in the hostel, they didn't bother
            with keys for that room. When Daria and I arrived, all of the lights were off and
            people were already sleeping so we put our sheets on the first empty beds that
            we could find and also went right to sleep. I didn't really mind the hostel since
            we would just be sleeping there and spending most of our time site-seeing.

      <h2>Dublin - Day One</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="trip-detail">
            In the morning, we had free breakfast at the hostel - toast with nutella, cereal,
            yogurt, and fresh fruit. We rented a small locker to store our valuables and then
            asked for directions to the best beach to see the ocean. At the convenience store
            next to the hostel, we bought a 3-Day Rambler Pass that would allow us to get on
            any Dublin Bus for the weekend. Later, we regretted buying it because we only
            used it to get to the beach and then to the airport. Dublin is small enough that 
            you can walk almost everywhere. Plus it is difficult to use the bus maps and even
            find the bus stops.
          </li>
          <li class="trip-detail">
            <b>Dollymount Beach</b> looked like a dried up pier at first because of the low 
            tide. We kept walking and discovered the most powdery soft sand and a great view
            of the ocean! There were so many dogs at the beach - dogs in Europe seem so 
            well-behaved! Daria and I were so excited to find small fragments of shells until 
            we found the endless amounts of beautiful whole shells. Even though the water was 
            cold and the tide was low, we enjoyed the view. Once we had gathered as many shells
            as we could carry, we headed back towards the bus stop. We quizzically watched 
            the people digging in the mud on our way back, wondering what they could be 
            searching for.

            After we dropped our shells off at the hostel, we headed out again towards Dame
            Street to explore and see <b>Trinity College</b>, one of the oldest and best colleges
            in Dublin.

            <b>Dame Street</b> was lined with gorgeous brick buildings and also rainbow flags! 
            This year (2010) was to be Dublin's very first Pride Parade! We were so disappointed 
            that we would not be here for the festivities (we ended up have a fantastic time
            at Paris' Pride Parade). Daria and I found a couple interesting indoor markets 
            and a Euro2 (similar to a Dollar Store).

           After dinner, we headed to O'Connell Street to see the famous <b>Dublin Post

           that is remarkably easy to spot from a distance. Because we had seen so many
           <b>Georgian Doors</b> on the way to the beach and on postcards, we especially
           wanted to see the North Georgian area - promised to have a high concentration of
           Georgian Doors. The doors are so colourful - they just feel so friendly and

            breakfast, we walked back to the Dublin Post Office to mail postcards and also
            to see what it was like during the day. We then tried to catch a bus to 
            <b>Saint Patrick's Cathedral</b> but found out that they were not running
            in that direction today. We decided to walk since it was not that far and on our
            way we got to see <b>Dublin Castle</b>. It wasn't the typical castle that I 
            picture, but obviously very nice. We then figured out that the buses were not 
            running in the area because they were setting up for the Halford's Tour Bike 
            Race!

            For lunch we stopped for smoothies near Christ Church as well as a delicious
            sandwich shop called Cafe Noto. We sat on the back steps outside Christ Church
            to eat and had a wonderful time people watching.

            Once we had rested our legs enough (and sufficiently eavesdropped on the 
            interesting lives of local Dublin-ers) we headed towards the <b>Guinness
            Storehouse/Brewery</b>. This was my first brewery tour of all time and I think
            that it somewhat ruined brewery tours for me forever because who could top 
            possibly top this?! It was so much better than I had expected - the tour
            buildings were so modern and it all takes place inside the world's largest
            pint glass. We did not see the beer being made, but we watched many videos 
            and learned about the history as well as the four simple ingredients that go
            into Guinness Beer.

            During the tour, we were able to sample some Guinness. At the end of the tour,
            at the top of the brewery, you have two options: either drink a pint of 
            Guinness while looking at a gorgeous panoramic view of the city OR learn how to 
            <b>pour your own perfect pint</b> of Guinness and see a slightly less gorgeous
            view of Dublin while you drink it. Daria and I obviously chose the latter option.
            The young man who taught us how to pour our pints had the greatest accent and 
            even said <cite>"rubbish"</cite>. I found out that Guinness tastes much better in
            Ireland that in the States. The Guinness Brewery tour was one of my favorite
            parts of Europe and I strongly recommend it.

            Once we had packed our bags and stored them with the front desk of the hostel,
            we decided to go to <b>Grafton Street</b>. Before going to the mall and stores,
            we stopped by <b>Stephen's Green Park</b>, one of the largest parks in Dublin.

            Next, we decided to go back to Dame Street to explore the indoor markets further
            to try to find presents for our roommates back in Paris. We stopped for lunch
            on Dame Street and I had the most delicious mango quesadillas that I would love
            to be able to replicate at home sometime!

            The bus to the airport from the hostel only took 20 minutes rather than the 
            hour we had expected so we had plenty of time to journal and write more 
            postcards. Our trip back to the apartment in Paris from the airport was an
            interesting journey. The train that would take us to the city from the airport
            was closed so we were routed onto buses without much understanding of where
            they would take us. Luckily, we eventually made it back to the apartment safely
            and we were very excited to see our lovely roommates and hear about their
            adventures. Instead of going to sleep right away, I wrote my paper that was 
            due the next day for our Political Science class.

      <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p id="trip-summary">
          Dublin ended up being my favorite city from my trip to Europe. I absolutely loved
          the hospitality and friendliness. All of the sites were accessible by foot and in
          my opinion it was the cleanest of the cities we had visited. I feel so blessed to
          have had the opportunity to have visited their wonderful city and experience some
          of their culture. Even though they were not in the World Cup Finals that year, they
          still had so much spirit and their restaurants looked so festive with all of the
          decorations. The idea behind the Claddagh: <b>love, loyalty, and friendship</b>
          is the perfect way to describe Ireland. I hope that I am lucky enough to return
          someday soon. We only spent a few days in Dublin, but I feel like we saw a vast
          majority of their popular tourist attractions. I would especially love to go back
          to see more of their country-side and non-urban areas.
