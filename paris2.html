      <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            The summer between my junior and senior year of college, I studied abroad for
            a month in Paris, France! 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            I had four roommates: Daria, Lisa, Maddy, and Urba. Our classmates were: Jad, Neil, 
            Khalid, Xiaochen, Xiaofeng, and Wenkan. Although we were all students
            at the <b>Illinois Institute of Technology</b>, I had only met Urba before the planning
            for this trip began. Together in Paris we all took a political science class about
            Global Economies taught by Professor Laura Hosman and a psychology class about 
            Impressionist painters with Professor Michael Young. 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            I've split my journals into weeks in Paris so that they are more manageable and
            so that you don't get a headache reading one long page about a month in Paris.
            I also have separate journals about weekend trips to Dublin and London. 
          </p>

      <h2>Paris - Day 8</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            We woke up early to meet Professors Hosman and Young at the school to go to the <b>flea markets</b> together. We rode the Metro to the end of the 4 line (<b>Port Clignancourt</b>). I had heard that these markets are huge, but I truly did not anticipate them being so large! I felt like even if we had spent an entire week there we would not have been able to see everything.
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            After lunch (and of course ice cream), I was at the antique market with Daria, Maddy, and Urba when I spotted <b>Serena Williams</b> (it could have been Venus, but I'm fairly certain it was Serena!). I was so excited but did not want to bother her for a picture. Another girl at the market overheard me telling my friends so she ran up to Serena and asked for a picture. Serena is even taller than you'd expect in person. The girls and I instead tried to take pictures with her in the background - I think that she noticed and tried to walk slowly through the market so that we'd be able to get one of her in the background. I regret not asking her for a picture, but it was great just seeing her!

            At the markets you do have to be careful and aware of your surroundings so that you are not pickpocketed. You also have to beware of men trying to sell you tickets to the Metro - they are creepy and very pushy. It can be unpleasant, but as long as you are firm, they leave you alone. The Metro station itself is crowded so keep an eye on your personal belongings - wherever there are crowds or many distractions it is safe to assume there are pickpocketers.

            We decided to take a quick power nap when we got back to our apartment and then got ready to go out to a fondue place that Jenny heard about. It is called <b>La Refuge des Fondus</b> and they cleverly serve wine in baby bottles to avoid the tax on wine served in glasses that all restaurants have to pay in Paris.

            The restaurant had writing all over the walls and the waiters help women climb over the tables to get to the booth on the inside. The restaurant is not very big and there is just one very long table (which is why you have to climb over the tables to get to half the seating). The wine (already very cheap in France) is not the best quality but very strong. It is also in the cheese fondue. We figured out that they will bring you coke in baby bottles instead of wine if you ask for it. A group of guys from Australia teased us about not drinking all of our wine. It is absolutely not the classiest fondue place but we went more for the experience than the food.

            After dinner, we walked to <b>Sacre Coeur</b> to see it at night and were sadly disappointed to find the people drink and litter there in the evenings. We also thought that the chapel would be more brightly lit at night too.

      <h2>Paris - Day 9</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            After going to bed at 2am, we (Daria, Maddy, and I) got up early to get ready to go to the <b>Louvre</b>. Unfortunately, since the other group that we were meeting up with decided to sleep in, we didn't leave for the Louvre until later. Since it was pouring rain and to save time, we decided to take the Metro there instead of walking. You can actually buy a packet of ten metro tickets, called a <b>carnet</b>, that will save some euros compared to purchasing individual Metro tickets each time.
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Since it was a <b>free day at the Louvre</b>, it was extremely crowded. The Louvre is enormous and there really is no way to see everything in just one day. The map (called Plans in French) of the museum showed us pictures of the most notable pieces of artwork in each area so we used that as our game plan. We spent most of our time in the Sully and Denon halls. I really enjoyed the glass pyramids as well as the extensive Egyptian collection.

            After the Louvre, our classmate, Jad, let us come over to his apartment and do some laundry. He was lucky enough to have a rare in-unit laundry machine. It was a very small and interesting washer that also did not have a dryer so we covered our entire studio apartment with wet clothes in hopes that they would dry soon.

      <h2>Paris - Day 10</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            For class today, I had to give a presentation about one of the books that we were assigned to read for our Political Science class. The book is
            <a class="link" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Travels-T-Shirt-Global-Economy/dp/0471648493"><cite>The Travels of a T-Shirt in a Global Economy</cite></a> 
             and actually enlightened me and opened my eyes to the cotton industry. 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            After class we went to H&amp;M (not too different from the ones in the States) and explored what we called a "passage" mall. These malls look like two story hallways in between residential buildings and have great stores inside. We discovered that the cookies that our friend Jad had been feeding us were 20 euros for just a small box! They were so delicious and we felt terrible that he convinced us to eat so many.  
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            We also stopped by a local grocery store, <b>Supermarche G20</b>. It is definitely an adjustment going grocery shopping almost every day to pick up fresh food (compared to in America where we usually shop for a week or two at a time). It feels much healthier. I've also become addicted to <b>Nutella</b>. I like how Europeans, especially here in Paris, use it like peanut butter. Sometimes we just pack Nutella sandwiches for lunch when we plan on being out for the day.

            We took a lot of cute group pictures at <b>Invalides</b> and we also witnessed an enormous protest. There were a ton of people dressed in hospital scrubs and we think they were heading to the foreign affairs building to protest Israel blocking medical aid to Palestine. There were police officers everywhere (heavily armed and dressed in SWOT gear) - we heard that they had used tear gas on a different protest earlier in the week so we quickly left. We were actually relieved to get back to our apartment to get a decent amount of sleep.

            I thought that the Parisian government's response to protests was harsh until I saw footage of California State Schools dousing their students with pepper spray during the Occupy and 99% Movements.

       <h2>Paris - Day 12</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            For class today we went on a field trip to the <b>Paris Stock Exchange</b>. They don't offer tours anymore because they don't have an actual trading floor since most of it is done online. We then walked to what we thought was a mint, but is actually a small <b>Money Museum</b> (kind of like the money museum at the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago - but they don't hand out shredded euros here).

            after dinner at a great Turkish restaurant (they have delicious doner kebabs). I wasn't expecting a lot from the movie, but it was actually pretty entertaining (might have something to do with how we haven't watched much tv while being here).

            Professor Young had us meet him at <b>Musee d'Orsay</b> for class today. I got in for free with the not-so-legitimate student ID card that I mentioned before. It was really funny that they accepted my card when they would not accept Urba's real international student ID card. Admission without a student ID card was five euros.

            I loved <b>Musee d'Orsay</b> a thousand times more than the <b>Louvre</b>. Don't get me wrong, the Louvre is gorgeous and the glass pyramids are great, but Musee d'Orsay is in an old train station and is beautiful architecturally and has amazing art. It also has an iconic clock at its entrance. I loved the incredible collection of Monets, Manets, and van Gohe. I'm in love with the Impressionist era of art so even though Musee d'Orsay is much smaller than the Louvre, I enjoyed my time there more.

            Urba loved the museum so much that she decided to stay behind by herself. She ended up getting lost for four hours on her way back to our apartment, which ended up being really stressful because Daria, Maddy, and I had a train to catch that evening to London. I was so relieved when she got home and we were able to catch our train with plenty of time!
