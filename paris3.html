      <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            The summer between my junior and senior year of college, I studied abroad for
            a month in Paris, France! 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            I had four roommates: Daria, Lisa, Maddy, and Urba. Our classmates were: Jad, Neil, 
            Khalid, Xiaochen, Xiaofeng, and Wenkan. Although we were all students
            at the <b>Illinois Institute of Technology</b>, I had only met Urba before the planning
            for this trip began. Together in Paris we all took a political science class about
            Global Economies taught by Professor Laura Hosman and a psychology class about 
            Impressionist painters with Professor Michael Young. 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            I've split my journals into weeks in Paris so that they are more manageable and
            so that you don't get a headache reading one long page about a month in Paris.
            I also have separate journals about weekend trips to Dublin and London. 
          </p>

      <h2>Paris - Day 16</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Daria, Maddy, and I slept in until noon today (we needed to make up for all of the nights in a row that we had just gotten a few hours of sleep). Daria and I were still in our pajamas and Maddy was out on her daily run when Urba and Lisa got back to the apartment from Rome. Urba told us about Rome while Lisa fell asleep (she ended up sleeping through the night!). 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Once Urba finished telling us about Rome, Daria, Maddy, and I got ready and left for the <b>Catacombs</b>. We took the Metro out there and got in line just before the cut off for closing. The Catacombs are truly unlike anything I have ever seen before. I was expecting an underground cemetery but it was just piles and piles of bones and skulls. I think it made it worse for me that the skulls and bones were neatly arranged in piles and even looked like they were designed. It was definitely not my favorite experience in Europe, but it opened my eyes to how things like this could exist. 
          </p>

            To brighten our day, we headed to the <b>Jardin de Luxembourg</b> and found an amazing chocolate store along the way. The Luxembourg gardens were beautiful and had a good mix of tourists and Parisians. We found a bagette, lunch meat, and hummus and decided to have a picnic dinner in the park.

            Professor Hosman took us to <b>UNESCO</b> after class today (and we started class later today). It is the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. We took the Metro there, but Jad and Neil got left behind when the Metro doors closed before they could hop on.  I was able to text Jad the directions but we ended up being late to our meeting with the UNESCO representative (and we missed our meeting with the US representative for UNESCO).

            I really enjoyed our time learning about UNESCO, especially since I had no idea that an organization like this existed.  In recent years, the United States cut funding to UNESCO due to economic crisis in 2011, critical funding that allows UNESCO to help build free and open societies. <b>UNESCO is the only UN agency with a mandate to promote Holocaust Education worldwide and also helps to keep the democratic spirit of the Arab Springs alive by training journalists to cover elections objectively</b> (these are just two of the important causes that UNESCO supports).

            Most of the stands were closing at the <b>Notre Dame markets</b> when we got there, but I was able to pick up some fresh daisies for the apartment. We then walked to the smaller island in the Seine, <b>Ile de Saint Louis</b>, in search of the famous <b>Bertillion ice cream</b> place. It turns out that there are four or five ice cream places all named Bertillion on the same block so we decided on the one with the long line and lady serving ice cream from a window. I tried raspberry and pear and shared with Maddy, who got rhubarb and apricot!

            We talked about <b>Berthe Morisot</b> in Professor Young's class today. She seemed like an incredible woman but also very up and down in her moods. Interestingly she became the sister-in-law of Edouard Manet by marrying his brother, Eugene.

            As a class, we took the train to <b>Marmottan Museum</b> only to find it closed so we then decided to go to <b>Pere Lachaise</b> - the largest cemetery in Paris. It is in a similar style of Graceland in Chicago, but much much larger and not as well organized. Many famous people are buried in Pere Lachaise, including Oscar Wilde, Jim Morrison, Seurat, Chopin, and Moliere.

            <b>Oscar Wilde's grave</b> was covered in lipstick kisses and quotes. Urba went off exploring on her own on our way to Oscar Wilde's grave. We looked for her and called her name, but the cemetery is really big and easy to get lost in. We had to leave the cemetery without her and I was worried because it closes at sunset.

            Maddy and Jad decided to go to a park near Pere Lachaise that ended up being really pretty with cliffs and waterfalls. Daria and I headed back with Lisa, Khalid, Neil and the professors. We wanted to do some laundry at the laundromat near school so we'd have clean clothes for the rest of our trip.    
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            The laundromat at school was more efficient than doing laundry at Jad's because the machines were much larger. The washer was 6.50 euros and the dyer cost only 3 euros. After Daria and I got some laundry done, we started researching trips to other countries for that weekend. Urba finally found her way back late that evening and didn't feel very well from all of the walking that she had done.

      <h2>Paris - Day 19</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Today we got out of class early because we didn't have any tours. Daria and I found flights to Dublin on GoVoyages for the weekend and booked a hostel on Hostelworld that Maddy recommended. Maddy seemed to be in a hurry to go to the markets and stores by Sacre Coeur so we felt bad that she waited for us to leave even though we had plenty of time since we got out of class early. It was a tense walk there. Once we got to the stores, we had a lot of fun exploring - there were really cheap thrift stores as well as small designer stores. I found some great souvenirs for my family and also a great dress that was a little bit expensive but a great splurge. 
          </p>
          
          <p class="trip-detail">
            When we returned from shopping, I was checking my email and was informed that GoVoyages needed a copy of my credit card and both sides of a valid ID or they could not book my tickets. I really wanted to go to Dublin, but I was concerned about identity theft. I tried to call GoVoyages using my prepaid phone but it ran out of credit so we decided to try a payphone outside. None of the payphones accepted coins but we found one that accepted credit cards. Daria and I both tried our cards to see if it would work with no luck and when we returned home we each had charges for $18.74 on our bank accounts. That was a very expensive phone call that did not even work! I whited out all of the important information and emailed it to GoVoyages but I became increasingly nervous about identity theft. Urba let me use her Skype account to call GoVoyages and the person I talked to told me that my flight had been cancelled because I did not get them the information on time.
          </p>
          
          <p class="trip-detail">
            I gave up on Dublin for the time being and decided to focus on homework. Maddy kept offering to buy me ice cream to make me feel better.  Once we finished up our homework, Daria, Urba, and I decided to use Expedia to try to find tickets since we had more experience using them in the past. We had successfully booked our flights and hostel when Urba realized that her visa not only excluded travel to London, but also to Ireland! Panicked, we found her numbers to call to try to get a refund. I was really worried when she was on the phone because she sounded so sad, but everything worked out and she was able to get her money refunded. I was relieved that she didn't have to pay for a trip that she couldn't take! I also felt very lucky to be an American citizen because we are fortunate enough to be able to visit most countries without a special visa. It had been a very stressful day so I was very happy to fall asleep that evening.

       <h2>Paris - Day 20</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            In class today, we talked about <b>Claude Monet</b> and I was very depressed to find out how much of a narcissist he was and how badly he treated other people, especially his wife, Camille. It was admittedly crushing to find out that my favorite artist, who created such beautiful paintings, could be such a terrible person. 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            After class, we went to <b>Marmottan Museum</b>, my new favorite besides the fact that you cannot take pictures inside. They have a wonderful collection of Morisots, Jackson Pollacks, and the most Monet's! They even had a special exposition on Monet's modern and abstract work. Marmottan also had my favorite Monet, Bras de Seine pres de Giverny - the one with lavender hues of trees on the water. The also have a smaller version of Paris Street: Rainy Day that is hanging in the Art Institute of Chicago by Caillebotte.

            isa got picked up at the museum by Super Shuttle to go to Germany again. Urba, Maddy, Daria, Khalid, Neil, and I went to a bakery nearby for lunch. We took the Metro back home and then Daria and I ran some errands to get ready for Dublin. While we were gone, Maddy and Urba found tickets to Prague! Daria and I had a quick dinner and then headed to Gare du Nord to catch the RER train to Charles de Guille airport. The RER ticket to the airport cost 8.50 euros and it wasn't too bad taking the Metro since we packed lightly for Dublin.
