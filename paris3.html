      <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            The summer between my junior and senior year of college, I studied abroad for
            a month in Paris, France! 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            I had four roommates: Daria, Lisa, Maddy, and Urba. Our classmates were: Jad, Neil, 
            Khalid, Xiaochen, Xiaofeng, and Wenkan. Although we were all students
            at the <b>Illinois Institute of Technology</b>, I had only met Urba before the planning
            for this trip began. Together in Paris we all took a political science class about
            Global Economies taught by Professor Laura Hosman and a psychology class about 
            Impressionist painters with Professor Michael Young. 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            I've split my journals into weeks in Paris so that they are more manageable and
            so that you don't get a headache reading one long page about a month in Paris.
            I also have separate journals about weekend trips to Dublin and London. 
          </p>

      <h2>Paris - Day 16</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Daria, Maddy, and I slept in until noon today (we needed to make up for all of the nights in a row that we had just gotten a few hours of sleep). Daria and I were still in our pajamas and Maddy was out on her daily run when Urba and Lisa got back to the apartment from Rome. Urba told us about Rome while Lisa fell asleep (she ended up sleeping through the night!). 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Once Urba finished telling us about Rome, Daria, Maddy, and I got ready and left for the <b>Catacombs</b>. We took the Metro out there and got in line just before the cut off for closing. The Catacombs are truly unlike anything I have ever seen before. I was expecting an underground cemetery but it was just piles and piles of bones and skulls. I think it made it worse for me that the skulls and bones were neatly arranged in piles and even looked like they were designed. It was definitely not my favorite experience in Europe, but it opened my eyes to how things like this could exist.

            To brighten our day, we headed to the <b>Jardin de Luxembourg</b> and found an amazing chocolate store along the way. The Luxembourg gardens were beautiful and had a good mix of tourists and Parisians. We found a bagette, lunch meat, and hummus and decided to have a picnic dinner in the park.

          <p class="trip-detail">
            Professor Hosman took us to <b>UNESCO</b> after class today (and we started class later today). It is the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. We took the Metro there, but Jad and Neil got left behind when the Metro doors closed before they could hop on.  I was able to text Jad the directions but we ended up being late to our meeting with the UNESCO representative (and we missed our meeting with the US representative for UNESCO).

            I really enjoyed our time learning about UNESCO, especially since I had no idea that an organization like this existed.  In recent years, the United States cut funding to UNESCO due to economic crisis in 2011, critical funding that allows UNESCO to help build free and open societies. <b>UNESCO is the only UN agency with a mandate to promote Holocaust Education worldwide and also helps to keep the democratic spirit of the Arab Springs alive by training journalists to cover elections objectively</b> (these are just two of the important causes that UNESCO supports).

            After UNESCO, we (Maddy, Daria, Khalid, Neil, Jad, and I) walked towards the Notre Dame markets. We passed <b>Invalides</b> along the way and were able to see the other side of it this time.

            Most of the stands were closing at the <b>Notre Dame markets</b> when we got there, but I was able to pick up some fresh daisies for the apartment. We then walked to the smaller island in the Seine, Ile de Saint Louis, in search of the famous Bertillion ice cream place. It turns out that there are four or five ice cream places all named Bertillion on the same block so we decided on the one with the long line and lady serving ice cream from a window. I tried raspberry and pear and shared with Maddy, who got rhubarb and apricot!

            After the Louvre, our classmate, Jad, let us come over to his apartment and do some laundry. He was lucky enough to have a rare in-unit laundry machine. It was a very small and interesting washer that also did not have a dryer so we covered our entire studio apartment with wet clothes in hopes that they would dry soon.

      <h2>Paris - Day 10</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            For class today, I had to give a presentation about one of the books that we were assigned to read for our Political Science class. The book is
            <a class="link" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Travels-T-Shirt-Global-Economy/dp/0470287160/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1363977759&sr=8-1&keywords=traveling+t-shirt"><cite>The Travels of a T-Shirt in a Global Economy</cite></a> 
             and actually enlightened me and opened my eyes to the cotton industry. 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            After class we went to H&M (not too different from the ones in the States) and explored what we called a "passage" mall. These malls look like two story hallways in between residential buildings and have great stores inside. We discovered that the cookies that our friend Jad had been feeding us were 20 euros for just a small box! They were so delicious and we felt terrible that he convinced us to eat so many.  
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            We also stopped by a local grocery store, <b>Supermarche G20</b>. It is definitely an adjustment going grocery shopping almost every day to pick up fresh food (compared to in America where we usually shop for a week or two at a time). It feels much healthier. I've also become addicted to <b>Nutella</b>. I like how Europeans, especially here in Paris, use it like peanut butter. Sometimes we just pack Nutella sandwiches for lunch when we plan on being out for the day.

            We took a lot of cute group pictures at <b>Invalides</b> and we also witnessed an enormous protest. There were a ton of people dressed in hospital scrubs and we think they were heading to the foreign affairs building to protest Israel blocking medical aid to Palestine. There were police officers everywhere (heavily armed and dressed in SWOT gear) - we heard that they had used tear gas on a different protest earlier in the week so we quickly left. We were actually relieved to get back to our apartment to get a decent amount of sleep.

            I thought that the Parisian government's response to protests was harsh until I saw footage of California State Schools dousing their students with pepper spray during the Occupy and 99% Movements.

       <h2>Paris - Day 12</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            For class today we went on a field trip to the <b>Paris Stock Exchange</b>. They don't offer tours anymore because they don't have an actual trading floor since most of it is done online. We then walked to what we thought was a mint, but is actually a small <b>Money Museum</b> (kind of like the money museum at the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago - but they don't hand out shredded euros here).

            After class we all went to see 
            <a class="link" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1261945/?ref_=sr_3"><cite>Sex and the City 2</cite></a>
            after dinner at a great Turkish restaurant (they have delicious doner kebabs). I wasn't expecting a lot from the movie, but it was actually pretty entertaining (might have something to do with how we haven't watched much tv while being here).

      <h2>Paris - Day 13</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Professor Young had us meet him at <b>Musee d'Orsay</b> for class today. I got in for free with the not-so-legitimate student ID card that I mentioned before. It was really funny that they accepted my card when they would not accept Urba's real international student ID card. Admission without a student ID card was five euros.  
          </p> 
          <p class="trip-detail">
            I loved <b>Musee d'Orsay</b> a thousand times more than the <b>Louvre</b>. Don't get me wrong, the Louvre is gorgeous and the glass pyramids are great, but Musee d'Orsay is in an old train station and is beautiful architecturally and has amazing art. It also has an iconic clock at its entrance. I loved the incredible collection of Monets, Manets, and van Gohe. I'm in love with the Impressionist era of art so even though Musee d'Orsay is much smaller than the Louvre, I enjoyed my time there more.
          </p> 
          
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Urba loved the museum so much that she decided to stay behind by herself. She ended up getting lost for four hours on her way back to our apartment, which ended up being really stressful because Daria, Maddy, and I had a train to catch that evening to London. I was so relieved when she got home and we were able to catch our train with plenty of time!
