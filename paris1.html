      <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            The summer between my junior and senior year of college, I studied abroad for
            a month in Paris, France! 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            I had four roommates: Daria, Lisa, Maddy, and Urba. Our classmates were: Jad, Neil, 
            Khalid, Xiaochen, Xiaofeng, and Wenkan. Although we were all students
            at the <b>Illinois Institute of Technology</b>, I had only met Urba before the planning
            for this trip began. Together in Paris we all took a political science class about
            Global Economies taught by Professor Laura Hosman and a psychology class about 
            Impressionist painters with Professor Michael Young. 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            I've split my journals into weeks in Paris so that they are more manageable and
            so that you don't get a headache reading one long page about a month in Paris.
            I also have separate journals about weekend trips to Dublin and London. 
          </p>

      <h2>Paris - Day 1</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Urba and I met at the Charles de Gaulle (CDG) airport and took the 
            <a class="link" href="http://www.supershuttle.com/Locations/CDGAirportShuttleParis.aspx">Super Shuttle</a> 
            together to our apartment (in the second arrondissement).  I highly recommend Super
            Shuttle - they were very nice and less stressful than taking the Metro (underground
            public transportation system and the cheapest option) and less expensive than taking a
            taxi (the most convenient option). One of our other roommates took a taxi to our
            apartment and it cost 54 euros compared to the 25 euros that we paid for the Super
            Shuttle.
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Once we arrived at our apartment, we did not know the code to get into the building and
            didn't have our keys yet. We had no way of getting in contact with our other roommates,
            but we were able to sneak in behind the postal lady. Once inside, we weren't sure which
            section of the building we were in. We decided to explore the building and shoved all of
            our suitcases into a tiny elevator (probably uncomfortable for two people to even stand
            in) and sat on top of them to ride to the second floor. Once upstairs, we tried ringing
            doorbells (which were not easy to associate to the correct apartment since they were
            haphazardly placed on different floors and throughout the hallway). After Urba rang a
            man's doorbell twice on accident, he kindly answered and told us that only families
            lived in that section of the building. We then dragged our luggage to the next section
            of the building and were about to go up the stairs when we saw Maddy and Daria (two of
            our roommates) enter the apartment building. Relieved, we went to see our apartment
            building (actually not in the section that were about to try next). 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            We had rented a very cozy studio apartment with a small lofted area that managed to fit
            beds for 6 people total (five of us would be sharing the apartment). The bathroom
            (especially for five girls) was small, but we had an understanding that we really
            wouldn't be spending much time in the apartment anyway. The building itself was 
            interesting - instead of being completely enclosed, the middle had a large courtyard
            area so all of the apartments were able to get sunshine and fresh air. 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            After Urba and I got settled and cleaned up, we all went to explore the second
            arrondissement near the apartment while waiting for Lisa (our final roommate) to arrive
            from the airport. A few hours later, we found her casually sitting in a cafe next to our
            apartment waiting for us (in retrospect that seemed like a much easier way to find us
            than randomly knocking on apartments in the building - but also not as much fun). 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Once Lisa got settled, we went to find our school on Rue Lafayette
            (Illinois Institute of Technology has studio space in Paris for its architecture
            students, but other study abroad programs are able to use the space for classes since
            the architecture students are mostly out on walking tours of the city) that was also in
            the second arrondissement not too far from our apartment - just a quick ten minute walk. 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            We then went to <b>Monoprix</b> (a store very similar to Target with a decent grocery
            section) to buy fixings for dinner. They actually sell almost all the same personal
            hygiene products so we could have purchased them there instead of bringing them with us
            from the States. I deeply regretted taking out my jacket at the airport when my suitcase
            was overweight when I could have taken out shampoo and conditioner! Paris is actually
            chilly and rainy compared to Chicago in May/June.  
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            I also noticed right away that a lot of the signage in Paris is actually conveniently
            in both French and English.   
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            After a quick dinner at our apartment, we decided to walk to the <b>Eiffel Tower</b>. It
            took us about two hours each way (utterly exhausting after a long international flight)
            but it was totally worth every blister. The Eiffel Tower is gorgeous at night and there
            are a lot of sites along the way, especially in Central Paris. We saved going to the top
            for another night since it was getting late and there was a long line (it was Saturday
            night). It didn't really hit me until seeing the Eiffel Tower that I was in Paris and at
            least for the summer the world was my oyster. This was a wonderful way to kick-off 
            a beautiful summer in Paris. 
          </p>

      <h2>Paris - Day 2</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Our plan for the day was to go to <b>Ile de Cite</b> - the larger of the two islands in
            the <b>River Seine</b> (the river that runs through the middle of Paris). This is the
            home of <b>Notre Dame</b> and <b>Sainte Chapelle</b>, two beautiful cathedrals. Ile de
            Cite is shaped like a boat and <b>Pont Neuf</b> (despite meaning New Bridge is actually
            the oldest bridge crossing the Seine) is at the bow. Pont Neuf has carvings of strange
            faces along the side, each face unique. When you're at the "bow" of Ile de Cite, it
            really does feel like you're on a large boat in the Seine - it offers beautiful views of
            Paris, especially the Louvre.

          <p class="trip-detail">
            Our next stop was <b>Sainte Chapelle</b>. The line looked very long but it moved quickly
            and the bottleneck was definitely going through security. Tickets were 5 euros with a
            student ID (one of our study abroad advisers created IDs for us that absolutely in no
            way looked legitimate but worked every single time). 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            King Louis IX (future Saint Louis) had Sainte Chapelle built to house <b>relics of the
            Passions of Christ</b> - the most famous relic being the <b>Crown of Thorns</b>, which
            was acquired for more than the cost of building the chapel itself. Ironically, many of
            the relics were melted down during the Revolution, including the Crown of Thorns, and
            all of the remaining relics are now housed in Notre Dame.
          </p> 
          <p class="trip-detail">
            The <b>lower chapel</b> (first floor) was mildly disappointing because of how much Sainte Chapelle was recommended by friends - but it made more sense when I found out it was intended to be a place of worship for the palace staff (and the upper chapel was meant for only the king and his close friends/family).
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail"> 
            The second floor/<b>upper chapel</b> took my breath away. My jaw dropped and I was
            amazed by all of the intricate details. There are 1,113 scenes depicted in the 15
            stained glass windows in the chapel and tell the story of mankind from Genesis to
            Christ's resurrection. All of the windows, except for the one depicting the Passion of
            Christ, should be read from left to right and starting at the bottom going upwards. The
            Passion of Christ is the only window intended to be read boustrophedonically (word of
            the day!) meaning every other line of writing is flipped or reversed, with reversed
            letters. Alternate lines in boustrophedon must be read in opposite directions and the
            individual characters are mirrored. Even with the main shrine area of the chapel under
            construction, I could understand why I was told that Sainte Chapelle is even more
            extraordinary than Notre Dame.

          <p class="trip-detail">
            On our way to Notre Dame, we discovered a lovely street market with fresh flowers,
            animals, and an obscene amount of souvenir shops. We saw hens and roosters, guinea pigs,
            mice, etc. There was one mouse that was extremely hyper while all of the other mice were
            sleeping. It had a little mustache so Daria and I named him Pierre. We had already seen
            quite a few dogs in Paris and couldn't help but notice how well-behaved and restrained
            they were.
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            <b>Notre Dame</b> had a huge line to get in (we originally had wanted to try to go to
            mass since it was Sunday) and since we were getting cold and hungry, we decided to walk
            around it. My camera died as we were leaving Sainte Chapelle so I did not get any
            pictures of Notre Dame or the street market. As we were leaving Notre Dame, a guy with a
            terrifying mask came up behind me and grabbed my hand. I was embarrassed that I screamed
            at the prank (I have a ridiculous fear of clowns and masks), but was able to laugh about
            it later. 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Maddy, Daria, and I changed into warmer clothes when we got home and headed right back
            out to see <b>L'Arc de Triomphe</b>. I never imagined it to be so large! We gave two
            smaller arches by our apartment, but the Arc de Triomphe had to be at least ten times
            bigger. More than the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame, I was in utter awe. Walking along
            <b>Champs Elysees</b> makes you realize the glamour and extravagance of Paris. Michigan
            Avenue/The Magnificent Mile in Chicago doesn't even come close.

            Paris feels much smaller than Chicago and I loved that a lot of major landmarks are
            within reasonable walking distance. Although it would have been a nice break for our
            legs to take the <b>Metro</b>, I enjoyed soaking in the city and seeing smaller sites
            along the way. Even though Paris was much dirtier than I had expected, it has some
            wonderful aspects that make up for it. There's also a bike sharing system that I wanted
            to try. I realized that a lot of life's happiness comes from the little things and today
            I found a lot of things that made me smile.

      <h2>Paris - Day 3</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            For the first day of class, Architecture Professor Tim Brown gave us a safety lecture
            and helpful hints about Paris. I think it was a good scare after starting to feel
            comfortable in Paris (my mother had me watch
            <a class="link" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0936501/?ref_=sr_2">Taken</a>  
            the day before I left for Paris - not great for the nerves). He talked a lot about how
            "soft-crime" like pickpocketing is much more prevalent in Paris than "hard-crime".

            Our professors took us to lunch at a very interesting restaurant and surprised us with
            t-shirts they had made for us. Professor Hosman gave us another surprise and took us to
            the <b>Eiffel Tower</b> and also a place where we could take a group photo with the
            Eiffel Tower in the background.  It was incredibly nice of her to pay for our tickets to

            Although it was very cold and windy, the incredible views were completely worth it! The
            Eiffel Tower is the tallest structure (all the other buildings except for the business
            sector in the outermost arrondissement have a six story height maximum) so you can see
            the entire city. There are also brave souls that climb the stairs to the top rather than
            taking the elevators.

            After class, we stopped by <b>Fnac</b> (a large electronics store similar to Best Buy) to try to purchase a prepaid phone, but had trouble finding someone who spoke English. <b>Orange</b>, a cell phone carrier, by Gallerie Haussmann had a lady that was very helpful. Afterwards, three of the guys in our class: Neil, Khalid, and Jad, helped us go grocery shopping and came over for dinner.

            I was extremely worried since it was difficult to communicate with him and his parents

            "soft-crime" like pickpocketing is much more prevalent in Paris than "hard-crime".

      <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p id="trip-summary">
          Dublin ended up being my favorite city from my trip to Europe. I absolutely loved
          the hospitality and friendliness. All of the sites were accessible by foot and in
          my opinion it was the cleanest of the cities we had visited. I feel so blessed to
          have had the opportunity to have visited their wonderful city and experience some
          of their culture. Even though they were not in the World Cup Finals that year, they
          still had so much spirit and their restaurants looked so festive with all of the
          decorations. The idea behind the Claddagh: <b>love, loyalty, and friendship</b>
          is the perfect way to describe Ireland. I hope that I am lucky enough to return
          someday soon. We only spent a few days in Dublin, but I feel like we saw a vast
          majority of their popular tourist attractions. I would especially love to go back
          to see more of their country-side and non-urban areas.
