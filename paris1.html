      <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            The summer between my junior and senior year of college, I studied abroad for
            a month in Paris, France! 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            I had four roommates: Daria, Lisa, Maddy, and Urba. Our classmates were: Jad, Neil, 
            Khalid, Xiaochen, Xiaofeng, and Wenkan. Although we were all students
            at the <b>Illinois Institute of Technology</b>, I had only met Urba before the planning
            for this trip began. Together in Paris we all took a political science class about
            Global Economies taught by Professor Laura Hosman and a psychology class about 
            Impressionist painters with Professor Michael Young. 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            I've split my journals into weeks in Paris so that they are more manageable and
            so that you don't get a headache reading one long page about a month in Paris.
            I also have separate journals about weekend trips to Dublin and London. 
          </p>

      <h2>Paris - Day 1</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Urba and I met at the Charles de Gaulle (CDG) airport and took the 
            <a class="link" href="http://www.supershuttle.com/Locations/CDGAirportShuttleParis.aspx">Super Shuttle</a> 
            together to our apartment (in the second arrondissement).  I highly recommend Super
            Shuttle - they were very nice and less stressful than taking the Metro (underground
            public transportation system and the cheapest option) and less expensive than taking a
            taxi (the most convenient option). One of our other roommates took a taxi to our
            apartment and it cost 54 euros compared to the 25 euros that we paid for the Super
            Shuttle.
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Once we arrived at our apartment, we did not know the code to get into the building and
            didn't have our keys yet. We had no way of getting in contact with our other roommates,
            but we were able to sneak in behind the postal lady. Once inside, we weren't sure which
            section of the building we were in. We decided to explore the building and shoved all of
            our suitcases into a tiny elevator (probably uncomfortable for two people to even stand
            in) and sat on top of them to ride to the second floor. Once upstairs, we tried ringing
            doorbells (which were not easy to associate to the correct apartment since they were
            haphazardly placed on different floors and throughout the hallway). After Urba rang a
            man's doorbell twice on accident, he kindly answered and told us that only families
            lived in that section of the building. We then dragged our luggage to the next section
            of the building and were about to go up the stairs when we saw Maddy and Daria (two of
            our roommates) enter the apartment building. Relieved, we went to see our apartment
            building (actually not in the section that were about to try next). 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            We had rented a very cozy studio apartment with a small lofted area that managed to fit
            beds for 6 people total (five of us would be sharing the apartment). The bathroom
            (especially for five girls) was small, but we had an understanding that we really
            wouldn't be spending much time in the apartment anyway. The building itself was 
            interesting - instead of being completely enclosed, the middle had a large courtyard
            area so all of the apartments were able to get sunshine and fresh air. 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            After Urba and I got settled and cleaned up, we all went to explore the second
            arrondissement near the apartment while waiting for Lisa (our final roommate) to arrive
            from the airport. A few hours later, we found her casually sitting in a cafe next to our
            apartment waiting for us (in retrospect that seemed like a much easier way to find us
            than randomly knocking on apartments in the building - but also not as much fun). 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Once Lisa got settled, we went to find our school on Rue Lafayette
            (Illinois Institute of Technology has studio space in Paris for its architecture
            students, but other study abroad programs are able to use the space for classes since
            the architecture students are mostly out on walking tours of the city) that was also in
            the second arrondissement not too far from our apartment - just a quick ten minute walk. 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            We then went to <b>Monoprix</b> (a store very similar to Target with a decent grocery
            section) to buy fixings for dinner. They actually sell almost all the same personal
            hygiene products so we could have purchased them there instead of bringing them with us
            from the States. I deeply regretted taking out my jacket at the airport when my suitcase
            was overweight when I could have taken out shampoo and conditioner! Paris is actually
            chilly and rainy compared to Chicago in May/June.  
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            I also noticed right away that a lot of the signage in Paris is actually conveniently
            in both French and English.   
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            After a quick dinner at our apartment, we decided to walk to the <b>Eiffel Tower</b>. It
            took us about two hours each way (utterly exhausting after a long international flight)
            but it was totally worth every blister. The Eiffel Tower is gorgeous at night and there
            are a lot of sites along the way, especially in Central Paris. We saved going to the top
            for another night since it was getting late and there was a long line (it was Saturday
            night). It didn't really hit me until seeing the Eiffel Tower that I was in Paris and at
            least for the summer the world was my oyster. This was a wonderful way to kick-off 
            a beautiful summer in Paris.

            After we dropped our shells off at the hostel, we headed out again towards Dame
            Street to explore and see <b>Trinity College</b>, one of the oldest and best colleges
            in Dublin.

            <b>Dame Street</b> was lined with gorgeous brick buildings and also rainbow flags! 
            This year (2010) was to be Dublin's very first Pride Parade! We were so disappointed 
            that we would not be here for the festivities (we ended up have a fantastic time
            at Paris' Pride Parade). Daria and I found a couple interesting indoor markets 
            and a Euro2 (similar to a Dollar Store).

            Our next stop was <b>Christ Church</b>. We were unable to go inside because of
            a wedding but I couldn't help but think about how beautiful it would be to get
            married there.

           For dinner, Daria and I decided to try a traditional Irish Place called
           <b>Gallagher's Boxty House</b>, recommended by our hostel. The chicken boxty that
           I had was delicious - a traditional Irish potato pancake filled with chicken. For
           dessert, we had homemade ice cream, a yummy treat that was a welcome change from
           all of the gelato that we had in Paris.

           After dinner, we headed to O'Connell Street to see the famous <b>Dublin Post
           Office</b> and the <b>Spire of Dublin</b>. The Spire looks like an enormous needle
           that is remarkably easy to spot from a distance. Because we had seen so many
           <b>Georgian Doors</b> on the way to the beach and on postcards, we especially
           wanted to see the North Georgian area - promised to have a high concentration of
           Georgian Doors. The doors are so colourful - they just feel so friendly and
           inviting!

           <b>The Samuel Beckett Bridge</b> is one of my favorite bridges in the world (it

           Calatrava to be in the shape of the Dublin Harp. Dublin, like Paris, stays fairly
           light outside until about 10 or 11pm so by the time we had gotten to this bridge,
           it was beginning to get dark. We encountered other drunk and slightly creepy men

      <h2>Dublin - Day Two</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            It was a gorgeous day outside and we felt so lucky to be in Dublin! After 
            breakfast, we walked back to the Dublin Post Office to mail postcards and also
            to see what it was like during the day. We then tried to catch a bus to 
            <b>Saint Patrick's Cathedral</b> but found out that they were not running
            in that direction today. We decided to walk since it was not that far and on our
            way we got to see <b>Dublin Castle</b>. It wasn't the typical castle that I 
            picture, but obviously very nice. We then figured out that the buses were not 
            running in the area because they were setting up for the Halford's Tour Bike 
            Race!

            <b>Saint Patrick's Cathedral</b> was jaw-dropping! We had seen beautiful 
            cathedrals in Paris - Notre Dame, Saint Chapelle, etc but this one felt much
            older and more regal in my humble opinion.

            For lunch we stopped for smoothies near Christ Church as well as a delicious
            sandwich shop called Cafe Noto. We sat on the back steps outside Christ Church
            to eat and had a wonderful time people watching.
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Once we had rested our legs enough (and sufficiently eavesdropped on the 
            interesting lives of local Dublin-ers) we headed towards the <b>Guinness
            Storehouse/Brewery</b>. This was my first brewery tour of all time and I think
            that it somewhat ruined brewery tours for me forever because who could top 
            possibly top this?! It was so much better than I had expected - the tour
            buildings were so modern and it all takes place inside the world's largest
            pint glass. We did not see the beer being made, but we watched many videos 
            and learned about the history as well as the four simple ingredients that go
            into Guinness Beer.

            During the tour, we were able to sample some Guinness. At the end of the tour,
            at the top of the brewery, you have two options: either drink a pint of 
            Guinness while looking at a gorgeous panoramic view of the city OR learn how to 
            <b>pour your own perfect pint</b> of Guinness and see a slightly less gorgeous
            view of Dublin while you drink it. Daria and I obviously chose the latter option.
            The young man who taught us how to pour our pints had the greatest accent and 
            even said <cite>"rubbish"</cite>. I found out that Guinness tastes much better in
            Ireland that in the States. The Guinness Brewery tour was one of my favorite
            parts of Europe and I strongly recommend it.

      <h2>Dublin - Day Three</h2>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Once we had packed our bags and stored them with the front desk of the hostel,
            we decided to go to <b>Grafton Street</b>. Before going to the mall and stores,
            we stopped by <b>Stephen's Green Park</b>, one of the largest parks in Dublin.
            It includes many statues and even a garden for the blind!

            We then stopped by the mall named for the park. It actually feels like you are 
            in a large green house because of the atrium style glass ceiling.

            Next, we decided to go back to Dame Street to explore the indoor markets further
            to try to find presents for our roommates back in Paris. We stopped for lunch
            on Dame Street and I had the most delicious mango quesadillas that I would love
            to be able to replicate at home sometime! 
          </p>
          <p class="trip-detail">
            The bus to the airport from the hostel only took 20 minutes rather than the 
            hour we had expected so we had plenty of time to journal and write more 
            postcards. Our trip back to the apartment in Paris from the airport was an
            interesting journey. The train that would take us to the city from the airport
            was closed so we were routed onto buses without much understanding of where
            they would take us. Luckily, we eventually made it back to the apartment safely
            and we were very excited to see our lovely roommates and hear about their
            adventures. Instead of going to sleep right away, I wrote my paper that was 
            due the next day for our Political Science class.

      <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p id="trip-summary">
          Dublin ended up being my favorite city from my trip to Europe. I absolutely loved
          the hospitality and friendliness. All of the sites were accessible by foot and in
          my opinion it was the cleanest of the cities we had visited. I feel so blessed to
          have had the opportunity to have visited their wonderful city and experience some
          of their culture. Even though they were not in the World Cup Finals that year, they
          still had so much spirit and their restaurants looked so festive with all of the
          decorations. The idea behind the Claddagh: <b>love, loyalty, and friendship</b>
          is the perfect way to describe Ireland. I hope that I am lucky enough to return
          someday soon. We only spent a few days in Dublin, but I feel like we saw a vast
          majority of their popular tourist attractions. I would especially love to go back
          to see more of their country-side and non-urban areas.
