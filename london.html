      <h2>Background</h2>
        
          <p class="trip-detail">
            During my Study Abroad trip to Paris in Summer 2010, we were able/encouraged
            to fly to other cities in Europe on the weekends since the price of 
            transportation to other European cities is usually very reasonable.
          </p> 
          <p class="trip-detail">
            Two of the five roommates that I had in Paris, Daria and Maddy, and I decided to
            take the Eurostar Train from Paris to London - it goes underneath the channel!

            I fell asleep when we went under the channel. Maddy said that it just feels like
            one really dark tunnel and wasn't anything too spectacular. We arrived in St.
            Pancras Station (the international counterpart to Kings Cross Station) at 10:30pm
            Paris time (9:30pm London time). The station was very nice, modern, and clean. They
            have a towering sculpture of a man and a woman kissing to greet you as you get off
            the train and enter the station. The marketing/advertisements throughout the station
            includes a picture of that sculpture with <cite>"Meet Me at St. Pancras!"</cite> as 
            the catchphrase. Kings Cross and St. Pancras connect and feel more like an airport due
            to sheer size rather than a train station.

            The walk from Kings Cross to our hostel in Russel Square took only about 20 minutes once
            we got our bearings. Compared to Paris, the streets were very quiet and not as well-lit,
            but they were much much cleaner. Our hostel looked like a nice place from the outside,
            but very crowded on the inside. Our twelve bed hostel room was like a very long dorm
            room lined with bunk beds on each wall with a small aisle to walk down the middle. Our
            hostel overall was very large - at one point I overheard the receptionist say that there
            were 94 beds free for Saturday evening. This hostel made me truly appreciate our small
            apartment in Paris that I shared with only 4 other ladies!

      <h2>London - Day 1</h2>
        
          <p class="trip-detail">
            After a quick (free) breakfast at the hostel, we headed out towards Buckingham Palace.
            Along the way, we passed <b>Trafalgar Square</b> that was all set up to celebrate the first day of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa! Even though England wasn't playing in the first day of the World Cup, there was still so much excitement!

            On the way to <b>Buckingham Palace</b>, we noticed people stopping and waiting
            along the side of the road. It wasn't until we heard bagpipes that we started to
            understand what was happening. We found out later that we were just in time for
            the <b>Changing of the Guards</b> that happens daily at 11:30am - what a lucky 
            accident! We saw a huge procession of bagpipers and guards!

            We saw the huge crowd heading towards the palace, so we took a side route through <b>St.
            James Park</b>. Almost as soon as we stepped onto the grass, a duck immediately ran up
            to us and if it could talk, I'm sure it would have asked us for some food. It was the
            most precocious duck ever. In <b>St. James Park</b>, there is an island in the middle of
            the pond, called <b>Duck Island</b>, with hundreds of ducks and other birds like
            pelicans and swans. I had never seen so many ducklings and baby swans (cygnets). A very
            sweet old man gave us his extra bread to feed them - a simple pleasure yet such an
            enjoyable and memorable experience for us.

            After the ceremony, we went to get pictures closer to the palace. As we looked through
            the gates at the palace and the guards, I couldn't help but think that we were treating
            them like zoo animals as we all stood gaping at them and snapping pictures. The palace
            was beautiful, but after seeing Versailles, it looked simple and ordinary.

            In the park in front of them, we found a peace camp. People had been camping there since
            May to protest for peace (and various other causes). We saw one area had their own
            sustainable/green energy producer powered by a bicycle.  All along the park, there were
            statues of famous leaders like Nelson Mandela and Winston Churchill. It was really
            interesting to see all the different forms of protest in Europe, as well as each
            government's response toward it. In Paris, it felt like people stormed the streets and
            then they were kept in check by heavily armed members of the military/police. In London,
            at least this particular protest, seemed very peaceful and in the spirit of Gandhi and
            Martin Luther King Jr. I loved the atmosphere of this peace camp.

           We then crossed the River Thames to get on the <b>London Eye</b>, probably the most
           touristy thing that I did in my time in Europe. It was on the bank of the river and
           reminded me of Navy Pier since the London Eye is basically a giant enclosed ferris wheel.
           The aquarium is also here but we decided it was too expensive and would take too much
           time to get through.  The view from the London Eye was incredible, but for the price, I'm
           not sure I would do it again.

           My camera died from over-use so I won't have any more pictures until Day 2. We then
           randomly discovered that we had WiFi so we used it to email two guys that were
           from our Paris group and also in London for the weekend.  We made plans to meet us at
           <b>Hyde Park</b> near the statue of Achilles. Once we had met up with them, we decided to
           find a place to eat. We were tempted by a Chipotle just for something familiar. Since all
           of us were very indecisive, we randomly ended up at a British Indian food place called
           <b>Maharajah of India</b>, which ended up being a wonderful choice. We then went for ice
           cream at the cafe next door - so delicious!! I have discovered that the ice cream/gelato
           in Europe is ah-mazing and I wish it was possible to take it home with me.

           Our plan for after dinner was to walk to the <b>Tower Bridge</b>/<b>London
           Bridge</b>/<b>Tower of London</b>, which we all thought were the same thing - boy were we
           wrong! On our way, we stopped by <b>St. Paul's Cathedral</b> which is gorgeous at night.
           The statue in front of it had donuts randomly placed all over it - funny but
           disrespectful at the same time. 
          </p>
          
          <p class="trip-detail">
           The <b>London Bridge</b> is a very simple bridge. There doesn't seem to be anything
           significant about it other than it was lit up pink/red that night! We actually walked to
           the <b>Tower of London</b> that evening, but because it was so dark, we didn't realize
           what it was. We decided to hop on the <b>Underground</b> to get home since we were
           exhausted from walking. The next day we found out that the one-way ticket home was 4
           pounds but we could have purchased an all day pass for 5.60 pounds and took the
           Underground to all of our sites.  We weren't too upset since walking around London was a
           great way to see things and get a sense of the atmosphere of the city.  We weren't sure
           how to transfer to the correct station and when we got off at one that we thought wasn't
           too far from our hostel, construction workers told us that we were miles and miles away
           and that we were crazy for trying to walk home. Feeling tired and confused by the
           directions that they gave us, we decided to find our own way home. The streets in London
           in the evening are very quiet and dark (not like Paris). I could sense that we were all a
           little freaked out so I was very relieved when the walk home ended up being less than a
           mile.

            In the morning, we checked out of our hostel but were able to store our luggage there
            for the day. We excitedly walked to the Russel Square Underground station and purchased
            a day pass, but then found out that most of the train lines were closed for the day.
            Although it was frustrating at first, we became experts on how to transfer between train
            lines in the Underground and maneuver around the closed lines.

            We finally made it to the stop near <b>Tower Bridge</b> and as we walked towards it, we
            passed the <b>Tower of London</b> again. It was very pretty during the day time, but it
            still did not look like much of a tower to me.

            We were supposed to meet the boys, Neil and Khalid, on the north side of <b>Tower
            Bridge</b>, but since the Underground lines were closed and we had no way of
            communicating, we figured it would take them longer to meet up with us. We waited for
            them for about 20 minutes and then decided to walk around and take pictures. I was
            fascinated by this bridge. It looks like such a permanent structure but it actually
            opens up to let boats through. We finally found the boys and walked back to Tower of
            London and St. Paul's Cathedral.

            As our final destination in London, we chose to go to <b>Queen Mary's Gardens</b>.  We
            hopped on the train to the Baker Street stop ("Basil of Baker Street" from the Great
            Mouse Detective movie kept running through my head). Neil and Khalid really wanted to
            try fish and chips so they bought them from a very "hole in the wall" restaurant. On the
            way to the gardens, we passed the <b>Sherlock Holmes Museum</b>! Queen Mary's Gardens,
            like St. James Park, had hundreds of birds and ducks!

            We went back to our hostel to pick up our bags and then got back on the Underground to
            get to Kings Cross/St. Pancras. Since all of us are Illinois Tech nerds, we all wanted
            to find <b>Platform 9 3/4</b> like in Harry Potter. Khalid went up to an employee at the
            station and just said, "This might be a silly question…" and before he could even finish
            she said, "NO, it's not a silly question!" and gave us directions without us even having
            to ask. I thought it was hilarious that they are asked so often that they don't even
            have to confirm that it is actually what we are looking for and just give us directions.

            St. Pancras is a very modern and nice train station. It actually looks like an expensive
            mall with all of the stores inside. The <b>South Africa 2010 World Cup USA versus
            England match</b> was only on for ten minutes (England scored a goal in the first three
            minutes) before we had to board our train.

            This time, I was able to stay awake when the train went under the channel.  Maddy was
            right - it just feels like you're going under a bridge for twenty minutes. I had
            imagined in my mind that I would have been able to see the ocean somehow.

            When we returned to our apartment we went right to sleep and slept until noon the next
            day, just in time for our other roommates, Urba and Lisa to return from Rome! It was so
            much fun exchanging stories and as lucky as I felt to have gone to London, I almost
            wished I had gone to Rome instead. London was great, but it was rainy and we didn't get
            to actually go inside very many of the buildings. Plus the food in London really cannot
            compare to Italy! I have Italy on my wish list for future trips though! For only two
            days in London, we saw quite a bit and I had a wonderful time.
