            During my Study Abroad trip to Paris in Summer 2010, we were able/encouraged
            to fly to other cities in Europe on the weekends since the price of 
            transportation to other European cities is usually very reasonable.

            I fell asleep when we went under the channel. Maddy said that it just feels like
            one really dark tunnel and wasn't anything too spectacular. We arrived in St.
            Pancras Station (the international counterpart to Kings Cross Station) at 10:30pm
            Paris time (9:30pm London time). The station was very nice, modern, and clean. They
            have a towering sculpture of a man and a woman kissing to greet you as you get off
            the train and enter the station. The marketing/advertisements throughout the station
            includes a picture of that sculpture with <cite>"Meet Me at St. Pancras!"</cite> as 
            the catchphrase. Kings Cross and St. Pancras connect and feel more like an airport due
            to sheer size rather than a train station.

            The walk from Kings Cross to our hostel in Russel Square took only about 20 minutes once
            we got our bearings. Compared to Paris, the streets were very quiet and not as well-lit,
            but they were much much cleaner. Our hostel looked like a nice place from the outside,
            but very crowded on the inside. Our twelve bed hostel room was like a very long dorm
            room lined with bunk beds on each wall with a small aisle to walk down the middle. Our
            hostel overall was very large - at one point I overheard the receptionist say that there
            were 94 beds free for Saturday evening. This hostel made me truly appreciate our small
            apartment in Paris that I shared with only 4 other ladies!

            After a quick (free) breakfast at the hostel, we headed out towards Buckingham Palace.
            Along the way, we passed Trafalgar Square that was all set up to celebrate the first day
            of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa! Even though England wasn't playing in the first
            day of the World Cup, there was still so much excitement!

            <b>Dollymount Beach</b> looked like a dried up pier at first because of the low 
            tide. We kept walking and discovered the most powdery soft sand and a great view
            of the ocean! There were so many dogs at the beach - dogs in Europe seem so 
            well-behaved! Daria and I were so excited to find small fragments of shells until 
            we found the endless amounts of beautiful whole shells. Even though the water was 
            cold and the tide was low, we enjoyed the view. Once we had gathered as many shells
            as we could carry, we headed back towards the bus stop. We quizzically watched 
            the people digging in the mud on our way back, wondering what they could be 
            searching for.

            This year (2010) was to be Dublin's very first Pride Parade! We were so disappointed 
            that we would not be here for the festivities (we ended up have a fantastic time
            at Paris' Pride Parade). Daria and I found a couple interesting indoor markets

           <b>Georgian Doors</b> on the way to the beach and on postcards, we especially
           wanted to see the North Georgian area - promised to have a high concentration of

           light outside until about 10 or 11pm so by the time we had gotten to this bridge,
           it was beginning to get dark. We encountered other drunk and slightly creepy men

      <h2>Dublin - Day Two</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="trip-detail">
            It was a gorgeous day outside and we felt so lucky to be in Dublin! After 
            breakfast, we walked back to the Dublin Post Office to mail postcards and also
            to see what it was like during the day. We then tried to catch a bus to 
            <b>Saint Patrick's Cathedral</b> but found out that they were not running
            in that direction today. We decided to walk since it was not that far and on our
            way we got to see <b>Dublin Castle</b>. It wasn't the typical castle that I 
            picture, but obviously very nice. We then figured out that the buses were not 
            running in the area because they were setting up for the Halford's Tour Bike 
            Race!

            For lunch we stopped for smoothies near Christ Church as well as a delicious
            sandwich shop called Cafe Noto. We sat on the back steps outside Christ Church
            to eat and had a wonderful time people watching.

          <li class="trip-detail">
            Once we had rested our legs enough (and sufficiently eavesdropped on the 
            interesting lives of local Dublin-ers) we headed towards the <b>Guinness
            Storehouse/Brewery</b>. This was my first brewery tour of all time and I think
            that it somewhat ruined brewery tours for me forever because who could top 
            possibly top this?! It was so much better than I had expected - the tour
            buildings were so modern and it all takes place inside the world's largest
            pint glass. We did not see the beer being made, but we watched many videos 
            and learned about the history as well as the four simple ingredients that go
            into Guinness Beer.

            During the tour, we were able to sample some Guinness. At the end of the tour,
            at the top of the brewery, you have two options: either drink a pint of 
            Guinness while looking at a gorgeous panoramic view of the city OR learn how to 
            <b>pour your own perfect pint</b> of Guinness and see a slightly less gorgeous
            view of Dublin while you drink it. Daria and I obviously chose the latter option.
            The young man who taught us how to pour our pints had the greatest accent and 
            even said <cite>"rubbish"</cite>. I found out that Guinness tastes much better in
            Ireland that in the States. The Guinness Brewery tour was one of my favorite
            parts of Europe and I strongly recommend it.

            Once we had packed our bags and stored them with the front desk of the hostel,
            we decided to go to <b>Grafton Street</b>. Before going to the mall and stores,
            we stopped by <b>Stephen's Green Park</b>, one of the largest parks in Dublin.
            It includes many statues and even a garden for the blind!

            We then stopped by the mall named for the park. It actually feels like you are

            Next, we decided to go back to Dame Street to explore the indoor markets further
            to try to find presents for our roommates back in Paris. We stopped for lunch
            on Dame Street and I had the most delicious mango quesadillas that I would love
            to be able to replicate at home sometime!

            The bus to the airport from the hostel only took 20 minutes rather than the 
            hour we had expected so we had plenty of time to journal and write more 
            postcards. Our trip back to the apartment in Paris from the airport was an
            interesting journey. The train that would take us to the city from the airport
            was closed so we were routed onto buses without much understanding of where
            they would take us. Luckily, we eventually made it back to the apartment safely
            and we were very excited to see our lovely roommates and hear about their
            adventures. Instead of going to sleep right away, I wrote my paper that was 
            due the next day for our Political Science class.

      <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p id="trip-summary">
          Dublin ended up being my favorite city from my trip to Europe. I absolutely loved
          the hospitality and friendliness. All of the sites were accessible by foot and in
          my opinion it was the cleanest of the cities we had visited. I feel so blessed to
          have had the opportunity to have visited their wonderful city and experience some
          of their culture. Even though they were not in the World Cup Finals that year, they
          still had so much spirit and their restaurants looked so festive with all of the
          decorations. The idea behind the Claddagh: <b>love, loyalty, and friendship</b>
          is the perfect way to describe Ireland. I hope that I am lucky enough to return
          someday soon. We only spent a few days in Dublin, but I feel like we saw a vast
          majority of their popular tourist attractions. I would especially love to go back
          to see more of their country-side and non-urban areas.
